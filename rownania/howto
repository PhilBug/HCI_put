Extract the number
Find the bounding box
Scale the image down to something like 10x8, try to match the aspect ratio
Do this for a small training set, take the 'average' image for each number
For new images, follow the steps above, but the last is just a absolute image difference with each of the number-templates. Then take the sum of the differences (pixels in the difference image). The one with the minimum is your number.
